# drone-assembly

## Objective: Build a drone from start to finish. I wanted to treat this like a rigorous personal project. I established a timeline, a budget, optimized my BOM, 3d modeled and printed my drone's frame, analyzed the frame through FEA and tests in real life, made every decision based on a justification, documented every step, and created a writeup for it.

## Contents: Assorted media from each stage of the project and the technical report
